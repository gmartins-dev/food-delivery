# Food Delivery App

A modern web application that allows users to search for restaurants that deliver to their area using the Just Eat API based on their outcode (first part of a UK postcode) and also filter restaurants by cuisine type.

This application follows the **PIE Design System** - Just Eat Takeaway.com's global design system for interfaces and experiences, ensuring consistency with the Just Eat brand.

## API Integration

The application integrates with the Just Eat API to fetch restaurant data. Key features of the integration include:

- Proper error handling for API failures
- Rate limiting protection with exponential backoff for 429 responses
- Type-safe API responses
- Mock data support for development and testing

## Running Locally

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-delivery.git
cd food-delivery

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### API Connection Issues

If you're experiencing issues connecting to the Just Eat API (such as CORS errors or rate limiting), the application includes a mock data mode. This is already enabled by default in the code.

The mock data can be found in `src/lib/api.ts` in the `MOCK_DATA` constant. You can modify this data to test different scenarios.

### Package Installation Issues

If you're having issues installing packages, try these steps:

1. Clear npm cache:
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

2. Delete node_modules and reinstall:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   ```

3. If you see specific errors about missing dependencies, try installing them individually:
   ```bash
   npm install <package-name>
   ```

## Building for Production

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start the production server
npm start
```

## API Integration Notes

This application interacts with the Just Eat API, which has certain limitations:

1. **CORS Issues**: The API may not allow direct browser requests due to CORS restrictions. For a production application, you might need to set up a proxy server.

2. **Rate Limiting**: The API implements rate limiting. The application handles 429 responses with exponential backoff.

3. **Mock Mode**: For development and testing, the application includes a mock data mode that can be toggled in the `src/lib/api.ts` file.

## Future Improvements

- Add unit tests with Jest/React Testing Library
- Implement server-side rendering for better SEO
- Add more filtering options (delivery time, rating, etc.)
- Implement pagination for large result sets
- Add geolocation support to automatically detect user's location
- Improve API error handling with more detailed messages

## Architecture Decisions

### Choice of Framework and Libraries

I chose **Next.js** with **React** as the primary framework for this application because:

1. **Performance**: Next.js provides excellent performance optimization out of the box.
2. **Developer Experience**: React's component model allows for a clean, modular codebase.
3. **Scalability**: The application could easily grow to include more features like restaurant details, orders, etc.
4. **SSR/SSG Capability**: While not implemented in this version, Next.js offers the option to server-render pages, which could improve SEO and initial load performance.

For styling, **Tailwind CSS** was chosen because:
1. **Utility-first approach**: Enables rapid UI development without leaving HTML
2. **Consistency**: Built-in constraints help maintain a consistent design system
3. **Performance**: Only generates CSS for used styles, resulting in minimal CSS

### Component Structure

The application is structured into reusable components following these principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: UI components (buttons, cards) are separated from business logic components (restaurant lists, filters)
2. **Composition over Inheritance**: Smaller components are composed to create more complex UI elements
3. **Container/Presentational Pattern**: Data fetching and business logic are separated from presentation components

Key components include:
- `SearchForm`: Handles outcode input and validation
- `RestaurantGrid`: Displays the list of restaurants
- `RestaurantCard`: Individual restaurant display
- `CuisineFilter`: Filtering functionality by cuisine

### API Integration Approach

The API integration follows these best practices:

1. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for various failure scenarios (network, 404, 429, etc.)
2. **Rate Limiting Protection**: Exponential backoff strategy for 429 responses
3. **Mock Data Support**: Fallback to mock data when API is unavailable
4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces ensure correct data structure handling

### Testing Approach

The testing strategy for this application would include:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components and functions in isolation
   - API service functions
   - Utility functions for filtering and data transformation
   - Form validation logic

2. **Component Tests**: Testing UI components with React Testing Library
   - Form submission behavior
   - Filtering functionality
   - Restaurant card rendering

3. **Integration Tests**: Testing the integration between components
   - Search form submission leading to restaurant data display
   - Filter selection affecting the restaurant list

4. **E2E Tests**: Full user flow testing with Cypress or similar
   - Complete user journey from search to filtering

### Package Manager Choice

For this project, I chose **npm** as the package manager because:

1. **Ubiquity**: Most widely used JavaScript package manager
2. **Stability**: Reliable dependency resolution
3. **Lockfile**: package-lock.json provides deterministic builds
4. **Integration**: Native integration with Node.js and excellent documentation

## Suggested API Improvements

Based on working with the Just Eat API, here are some suggested improvements:

1. **Pagination Support**: The API returns all restaurants at once, which could be problematic for areas with many restaurants. Pagination would improve performance.

2. **Filtering Options**: Server-side filtering would be more efficient than client-side filtering, especially for large datasets.

3. **Consistent Data Structure**: Some restaurant data appears inconsistent (missing fields, different format for similar data).

4. **CORS Support**: The API doesn't support direct browser requests, which complicates frontend integration.

5. **Rate Limiting Documentation**: Clear documentation on rate limits and retry strategies would be helpful.

6. **Schema Documentation**: Comprehensive OpenAPI/Swagger documentation would make integration easier.
